I am a Maître de Conférence (Associate Professor) in the Laboratory of Electronics, Antennas and Telecommunications (LEAT) of the Université Côte d'Azur (UCA), Sophia Antipolis, France. 

I received the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Technology from the University of Trento, Italy, in 2007 and 2011, respectively. During my Ph.D. I have been visiting researcher at the Pennsylvania State University, USA, and the University of Nagasaki, Japan.

At the moment, my research focuses on reconfigurable, miniature, multi-standard antennas for Internet-of-Things applications, wearable devices and 5G terminals.
